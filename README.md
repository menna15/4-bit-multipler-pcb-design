# PCB_Design
 A PCB design for a 4-bits multiplier.
 Mechanism:
 1- the user enters the two numbers - 3 and 4 bits- using dip switches in their 2's complement form.
 2- the two numbers are multiplied in the -multiplier- unit.
 3- the product is divided into two parts: integer and decimal.
 4- the integer part goes to the -int to BCD- unit, the same for the decimal part goes for the -decimal to BCD- unit
 5- after being converted into BCD the two parts are represented on three 7-segments.
 6- there is sign flag besides the 7-segments
 *this project is served as a partial fulfillment of the Requirements for CMP1010 -logic design- for the first-year computer engineering department 2019-2020 {Cairo university, faculty of engineering}
